        <p>I like making the drawings because through drawing you can express various emotions, train of thoughts, and collective feelings. ... Through drawing you can express what you feel, what you want, your perception, etc. I try to make some new pictures in my spare time. Whenever I draw a picture, I love it. In my school also my teacher says that my drawing is best in the class and she also love my drawings.

        <h1> Leonardo da Vinci <br>
            <h2>Leonardo da Vinci born on 15 April 1452, and died on 2 May 1519. He was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor and architect. While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he also became known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. Leonardo's genius epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his collective works compose a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary, Michelangelo.</h2>

        <h1>A. P. J. Abdul Kalam <br>
            <h2>A. P. J. Abdul Kalam's full name is Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam. He born on 15 October 1931 and died on 27 July 2015. He was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</h2>
